Set of functions to open a Java import statement as a file.
Maintained by Darren Greaves http://boncey.org/showBlog.go?id=138
Suggested stuff to add to your ~.vimrc:
let $JAVASOURCEPATH="$SERVLET_HOME/src/share,$JAVA_HOME/src,$XML_HOME/src"
map H :call OpenJavaImport($JAVASOURCEPATH)<CR>
Then press H while on a import line and the file should open (you'll need the
source files and the path to have been set already.

The paths in $JAVASOURCEPATH should have the source packages directly
underneath each path.  The script needs to be able to add the package to the
path element and open a file.
